### **TownyDiscordCommands**
TownyDiscordCommands allows you to have a few essential display commands in your\
Discord server in order to connect to the Towny Universe.

There are currently three commands available:
- /resident
- /nation
- /town
### **Setup**
All of these can be used on your discord server if you follow the steps below to setup this plugin:
- Set up your discord application and bot at https://discord.com/developers/ .
- Generate a bot in the "Bot" tab of the application.
- Go to the OAuth2 tab, and invite your bot to your Discord server with the following permissions:

- It does not need more than that. It is safe to not give your bot more permissions than it needs, in case somebody hacks into it.
- Install the Plugin from https://github.com/darthpeti/TownyDiscordCommands .
- Go to the "Bot" page on the developer browser application, click "reset token" or "generate token" and copy it.
- Put this token in the "token:" config section located in */server-dir/plugins/TownyDiscordCommands/config.yml*
- WARNING: DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN WITH ANYONE! IF YOU DO, ALWAYS RESET IT!

### **Server Requirements**
